          <p>The Linne&rsquo;s two-toed sloth is so named because it has just two toes on its forelimbs; its rear limbs,
            as with all sloths, have three. Sloths are tree-dwellers who spend the majority of their time hanging upside
            down. True to their name, sloths lead a laid-back life, attributable to their slow metabolism. They climb
            only about 6 to 8 feet per minute, sleep about 15-18 hours a day, and hit the ground of their rainforest
            habitat only about once a week to urinate and defecate.</p>

          <p>In size and shape, the sloth can be compared to a small dog. These tree-dwelling herbivores have relatively
            flat faces with a short, dark snout. Their front legs are longer than their rear legs, but all four are long
            and thin, making them very adept at hanging. As its name &ldquo;two-toed sloth&rdquo; suggests, its front
            limbs have--you guessed it-- two toes. However, like all species of sloths, its rear limb has three toes.
            All four of its feet have very calloused pads. Sloths are also covered in two layers of thick hair. The
            outer layer can be about 6 inches long and provides a perfect, moist environment for the growth of many
            organisms. Their hair actually grows in the opposite direction of most mammals because sloths spend the
            majority of their lives upside-down!</p>

          <p>They're born with a set of hollow molars used for grinding food, and these teeth have the ability to grow
            continuously throughout the sloth&rsquo;s life. Due to sloths' flattened faces, short snouts, and lack of
            teeth in the front of their mouths, they use their hardened lips to grasp and tear vegetation. They have
            relatively poor hearing and vision, but their keen sense of smell helps them find food. Although the front
            legs are longer than the back, the sloth&rsquo;s long, thin limbs are designed for climbing and hanging. At
            the end of their toes are 3- to 4-inch curved claws that are useful in climbing, gathering food, and for
            defense.</p>

          <p>Sloths are omnivores, but eat mostly vegetation, preferring buds, tender shoots and leaves. Extremely low
            rates of metabolism allow sloths to survive on relatively little food. Some research suggests that it may
            even take up to a month for food to fully digest!</p>

          <p>Sloths are generally solitary and adults pair solely in order to mate. Breeding occurs year-round. The
            gestation period is five to six months. Mothers give birth upside-down in the trees, and babies immediately
            seek the shelter of her chest for protection and to begin nursing. The young nurse for one month and during
            that time &ldquo;inherit&rdquo; a preference for certain foods from their mother. This specialization of
            diet is thought to minimize competition with other sloths in the same forest. Babies are 10 inches in length
            and weigh 12 ounces when born. They cling to their mother's belly for five weeks until they have the
            strength to move on their own. The young leave their mother after nine months. Females reach sexual maturity
            in three years and males at four to five years.</p>

          <p>Sloths receive their common name from the slow-paced lifestyle that they lead. Their average climbing speed
            is only 6 to 8 feet per minute. Sloths are extremely cautious. They're unable to support their own body
            weight in order to walk on the ground and, as a result, rarely leave the trees. They come to the ground only
            about once a week to urinate and defecate. When on the ground, they're forced to drag themselves forward,
            using their clawed forelimbs. Luckily, they're able to swim and will enter water to cross a river or to cool
            off.</p>

          <p>Primarily nocturnal, sloths sleep 15 to 18 hours a day. Their average body temperature can vary
            approximately 10 degrees daily.</p>
